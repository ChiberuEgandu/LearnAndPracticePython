# Why python needs data types? 
#Uses data types to ensure rules are followed for different data types

# the variable a has a value of 10. The value 10 has the data type integer
a = 10  


# the variable b has a value of hello. The value hello is a string
b = "Hello"  

# the varable c and d have the values true and false. The vallues true and flase are boolean
c = True
d = False 

# the variable e has a value of  3.1. The value 3.1 is a float
e = 3.1

# the variable f has the value None. This means there is no data type for the variable
f = None
